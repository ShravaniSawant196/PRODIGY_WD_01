PRODIGY_WD_01: Interactive Landing Page
This project is a responsive landing page developed as part of the Prodigy Web Development Internship, Task 1. The goal was to create a modern web page with an interactive navigation menu.

Features
Responsive Design: The layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Interactive Navigation Bar: The fixed navigation menu at the top of the page changes its background color and adds a subtle shadow when the user scrolls down, improving readability and user experience.

Smooth Hover Effects: The menu items change color on hover to provide visual feedback to the user.

Mobile-Friendly Menu: A hamburger menu button is included for easy navigation on smaller screens.

Dynamic Content: The page includes distinct sections for a hero area, features, pricing, and a contact form.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the fundamental structure of the web page.

CSS: Used for custom styling, including the transition effects for the navigation bar.

JavaScript: Powers the interactive scroll behavior and the mobile menu toggle functionality.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that enabled rapid and responsive styling.
